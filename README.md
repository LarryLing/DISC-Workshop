# Overview
The CatsConnect web application is designed to help foster social connections among students on campus. This platform allows students to create profiles, view and filter other students' profiles based on various criteria, save profiles of potential connections, and facilitate communication between students in a fun and engaging way.

# Features
## 1. Student Profiles:
Students can create personalized accounts with their profiles, including basic information such as name, interests, and bio.

### 2. Profile Viewing & Filtering:
Users can view other students' profiles and filter the profiles by different criteria, such as shared classes, common interests, or favorite activities.

### 3. Profile Saving:
Students can save profiles of others they are interested in connecting with, and view the list of profiles theyâ€™ve saved at any time.

### 4. In-App to Out-of-App Connections:
The platform includes a feature to help students take their connections offline by providing ways to contact saved profiles through email or social media links.

# Design Philosophy
The application aims to create genuine, meaningful connections between students by helping them discover common interests and shared experiences. The platform can be customized to cater to different social preferences, from academic collaborations to casual friendships based on quirky commonalities (like favorite memes).

# Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
